REST API

Endpoints
pole.com/api/pokemon
pole.com/api/pokemon/123

Drawbacks :
Over Fetching 
Under Fetch: When we want data from multiple endpoints.

In Rest api we create Routes.
But in GraphQL we make Schema. We have to give Resolver and TypeDefs are compulsory

If we want to fetch something from GraphQL Server: Query
If we want to send something to the GraphQL Server: Mutation
